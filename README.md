# What?
Software renderer, using python 🐍 and [pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) 🔳
# Why?
Learning about rendering in general through creation of my own renderer. 

Python was chosen as I am most comfortable with it (also sets the expectations at a level apt for a first-time endeavour 😅), and Pyxel provides a nice framework that limits the things I need to think about at the same time 🧠🗑

🐌 *Performance is **not** a primary concern, but >10 FPS is preferred*
# How?
📖 [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) provides excellent guidelines, and is overall my main source.
