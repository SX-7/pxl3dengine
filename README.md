# What?
Software renderer, using python and [pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel)
# Why?
Learning about rendering in general through creation of my own renderer. 
Python was chosen as I am most comfortable with it, and Pyxel provides a nice framework that limits the things I need to think about at the same time.
*Performance is **not** a primary concern, but >10 FPS is preferred*
# How?
[Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) provides excellent guidelines.
